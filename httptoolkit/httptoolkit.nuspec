HTTP Toolkit is a suite of open-source tools for debugging, testing, and building with HTTP(S) traffic. It offers a powerful, simple interface to capture, view, and manipulate HTTP requests and responses. HTTP Toolkit is composed of several repositories, read the README for more information.

## Features
- **HTTP Debugging**: Debug any HTTP(S) traffic from any app, instantly.
- **Automatic Setup**: Auto-configure your device or use manual setup.
- **Interception**: Intercept &amp; rewrite HTTP traffic on the fly.
- **Real-time View**: See the whole conversation in real-time.
- **HTTPS Support**: Full support for intercepting HTTPS traffic.
- **Mock &amp; Edit**: Mock endpoints, rewrite requests, and responses.
- **Powerful Filters**: Filter traffic by URL, headers, body, and more.

The [httptoolkit GitHub organization](https://github.com/httptoolkit) contains the entire project, including the account management servers and paid features. All components are open source, licensed under a mixture of copyleft AGPL and permissive Apache-2/MIT licenses.

All repos:
* [HTTP Toolkit Website](https://github.com/httptoolkit/httptoolkit-website) - the source for [the website](https://httptoolkit.com), including the marketing pages, the blog, and the docs.
* [HTTP Toolkit UI](https://github.com/httptoolkit/httptoolkit-ui) - the core of the product, a TypeScript + React app that powers most of the functionality you use, except for things that can't be done in a web page (i.e. starting a proxy, and setting up client interception).
* [HTTP Toolkit Server](https://github.com/httptoolkit/httptoolkit-server) - the backend of the product, a TypeScript + node.js server that does the things the UI can't do: starting a proxy, and setting up client interception.
* [Mockttp](https://github.com/httptoolkit/mockttp) - the HTTP(S) proxy itself, and all low-level logic around that, as a standalone TypeScript library. Used in HTTP Toolkit for traffic interception, but also usable standalone as a testing tool, or as a programmatically controllable intercepting HTTP(S) proxy.
* [HTTP Toolkit for Android](https://github.com/httptoolkit/httptoolkit-android) - the Android app, a native Kotlin + Java app that manages certificate trust &amp; enforces HTTP interception on Android devices.
* [HTTP Toolkit Desktop](https://github.com/httptoolkit/httptoolkit-desktop) - a TypeScript + Electron wrapper, which combines the UI &amp; the server and builds convenient per-platform installers.

Each repo has a README explaining setup and functionality.
