        <description>### Detailed Description

**Note:** Intel recommends that end users utilize driver updates provided by their system manufacturer/provider or via Windows Update to eliminate the potential impact caused by loading non-customized drivers. System manufacturers regularly customize Intel generic drivers to meet the needs of their specific system design. In such cases, use of the Intel generic driver update is not recommended.

The SetupRST.exe is the new installer that will install the Intel RST driver and start the process of installing the Intel® Optane™ Memory and Storage Management application.

### Purpose

The Intel® Rapid Storage Technology (Intel® RST) Driver supports the configuration and enabling of multiple features including:

- System acceleration with Intel® Optane™ memory
- Configuration and maintenance of RAID 0/1/5/10

**This package deploys the suitable Intel RST driver in alignment with your computer's CPU generation**, as detailed in Intel's [official guidelines](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000091087/technologies/intel-rapid-storage-technology-intel-rst.html).

You can find more information about each driver's version by visiting the Intel RST download page associated with your computer's CPU generation.

### Package Notes

As of May 2025, Intel revised its driver pages, consolidating support for 11th-13th Gen platforms under 12th and 13th Gen listings. [This page](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download/720755/intel-rapid-storage-technology-driver-installation-software-with-intel-optane-memory-11th-and-12th-gen-platforms.html) was removed entirely. Due to this change, the RST version used for 11th Gen systems has been adjusted. If this update introduces issues on your systems, we recommend avoiding Intel RST updates via Chocolatey, as Intel tends to modify its platform mappings and versioning without warning.</description>
