## Package Note

This package supersedes the `netscan32` and `netscan64` packages. You should consider uninstalling the deprecated packages to prevent any confusion.

SoftPerfect frequently updates the executable but keeps the same download URL. As a result, the checksum might change, and you may need to use `--ignore-checksum` with this package.</description>
