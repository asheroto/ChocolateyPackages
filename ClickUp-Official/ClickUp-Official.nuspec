- **Customizability:** From custom statuses to custom fields, ClickUp is fully adaptable to your team's needs and your project's requirements.

## Notes
The ClickUp executable that is downloaded upon package installation uses the same URL for each version. That means that when ClickUp releases a new version, it breaks the checksum since the file is different. Because the EULA does not allow for distribution, the executable cannot be included in the package. Therefore, this package will break.

The package maintainer has a monitor that detects when the ClickUp version changes, and updates are usually released in a day or two following an update. However, approval times for Chocolatey packages can vary, so you may see a checksum error on this package when an update occurs.

**Workarounds:**
- Look under [Version History](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/ClickUp-Official#versionhistory) and install the latest version with the `--version VERSION_NUMBER` argument.
- Use the `--ignore-checksum` argument to install the latest approved version (ignore checksum not generally recommended).
- Wait for the latest version to be approved.</description>
