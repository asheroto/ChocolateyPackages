[Laravel Herd](https://herd.laravel.com/windows) is a blazing fast, native Laravel and PHP development environment for Windows, providing all necessary tools for Laravel development, including PHP and nginx, with Herd Pro offering local service management for databases, caches, and additional testing and debugging capabilities.
